# Relativity-Man
A side scrolling game with a relative twist.

## Getting Started
So I'm not too sure how running this will work on other computers (specifically if you need to install the pygame library).
If you don't, then playing the game is pretty simple: On the command line type "py main.py" (windows) or "python main.py" (linux).
If you do need to install the pygame library, either install it, and/or check in with me.

### Prerequisites
To play the game, you need python installed. This was developed 
with [python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and so its
your best bet, but for the most part any python 3 version should work.

In addition, it is developed with the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news) 
which you may need to install. In pycharm, you can just click on the 
broken import and it can automatically install it.

[pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a development environment which takes care of the above.
One simple way to play is to download this, then check the files for broken imports (underlined in red).
Right clicking on them will install the pygame library, and you'll be good to go!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
