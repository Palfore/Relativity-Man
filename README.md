# Relativity-Man
A side scrolling game with a relative twist.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to play & develop is to install [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
as it contains all the required tools. Otherwise:

### Prerequisites
To play the game, you need python installed. This was developed 
with [python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and so its
your best bet, but for the most part any python 3 version should work.
In pycharm, this is automically installed.

In addition, it is developed with the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news) 
which you may need to install. In pycharm, you can just click on the 
broken import and it can automatically install it.
